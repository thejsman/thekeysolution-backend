                    <li>Due to the competitiveness of some keywords/phrases, ongoing changes in search engine ranking algorithms,
                      and other competitive factors, the www.thekeysolution.indoes not guarantee #1 position or consistent
                      top 10 positions for any particular keyword, phrase, or search term. </li>
                    <li>Google has been known to hinder the rankings of new websites (or pages) until they have proven their
                      viability to exist for more than 6 months. This is referred to as the “Google Sandbox”. The www.thekeysolution.in
                      assumes no liability for ranking/traffic/indexing issues related to Google Sandbox penalties.</li>
                    <li>Occasionally, search engines will drop listings for no apparent or predictable reason. Often, the listing
                      will reappear without any additional SEO. It is agreed and acknowledged that should a listing be dropped
                      during the SEO campaign and does not reappear within 30 days of campaign completion, the www.thekeysolution.in
                      will re-optimize the website/page based on the current policies of the search engine in question.</li>
